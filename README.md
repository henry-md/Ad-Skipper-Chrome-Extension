# Extension Uses
This is adds ad-skipping functionality to Chrome as a Chrome extension.

While this is packaged as a Chrome extension, I also personally use it for Safari. You just need to find a method to inject the CSS and JS into the page. I use PageExtender for this in Safari.

# How to Use
- Skip all ads (and all videos) by holding 'option' and pressing '+'.
- Speed up any videos by pressing option and holding another letter. The speed of the video will vary depending on the key:
    - 1: 1.0x
    - 2: 2.0x
    - 3: 3.0x 
    - etc... to 0, which is 10x.

    - q: 1.5x (q is between 1 and 2 on keyboard)
    - w: 2.5x (w is between 2 and 3 on keyboard)
    - e: 3.5x (e is between 3 and 4 on keyboard) 
    - etc... to o, which is 9.5x

    - j: - 0.1x or - 1x (video speed will decrement by 0.1 or 1 if the current video speed is below 10x or over 10x, respectively.)
    - k: + 0.1x or + 1x (video speed will increase by 0.1 or 1 if the current video speed is below 10x or over 10x, respectively.)

    - `: 0.5x (because it's the symbol before 1)
    - -: 20x
    - +: 1000x
