    - 2: 2.0x
    - 3: 3.0x 
    - etc... to 0, which is 10x.

    - w: 2.5x (w is between 2 and 3 on keyboard)
    - e: 3.5x (e is between 3 and 4 on keyboard) 
    - etc... to o, which is 9.5x

    - j: - 0.1x or - 1x (video speed will decrement by 0.1 or 1 if the current video speed is below 10x or over 10x, respectively.)
    - k: + 0.1x or + 1x (video speed will increase by 0.1 or 1 if the current video speed is below 10x or over 10x, respectively.)
    - -: 20x
    - +: 1000x (thus the ad-skipper)
